- Each group should write a code review of at least 20 comments on the next groups project the day before presentations.
- The code syntax must adhere to the PSR-12 standard. If not, your project wont be approved and you'll get an extra assignment.

- Oh, by the way, you can't use any fancy-pantzy JavaScript frameworks, **this is a backend assignment**. If you do want to write JavaScript it should be vanilla and just some basic stuff. Discuss this with your teacher.
